## Brief Report of Data Analysis Findings

The analysis of the COVID-19 research metadata revealed several key insights:

- **Publication Trends:** The number of research papers published on COVID-19 increased rapidly during the initial outbreak years, peaking in 2020 and 2021. This trend is visualized in the `publications_over_time.png` chart.
- **Top Journals:** A small number of journals contributed a significant portion of the published research, as shown in the `top_journals.png` bar chart. The top 10 journals were identified and visualized.
- **Title Word Cloud:** The most frequent words in paper titles included terms like "COVID", "SARS", "coronavirus", "pandemic", and "health", reflecting the main research focus areas. This is illustrated in the `title_wordcloud.png`.
- **Source Distribution:** Papers originated from a variety of sources, with some sources contributing more heavily to the dataset. The distribution is shown in `paper_source_distribution.png`.
- **Data Cleaning:** Significant missing data was found in some columns, requiring careful cleaning and filtering to ensure reliable analysis. Only papers with complete metadata (title, abstract, publish time, journal) were included in the main analysis.

## Reflection: Challenges and Learning

**Challenges:**
- Handling missing and inconsistent data required robust cleaning steps, especially for publication dates and journal names.
- Visualizing large datasets efficiently and interactively (using Streamlit) was a new experience, requiring optimization for performance and usability.
- Extracting meaningful insights from text data (titles and abstracts) involved basic natural language processing and filtering out common stop words.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Improved skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis using pandas and numpy.
- Gained experience in creating interactive dashboards with Streamlit and generating visualizations with matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud.
- Learned how to communicate findings effectively through visualizations and concise reporting.
